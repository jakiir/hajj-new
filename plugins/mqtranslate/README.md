**DEPRECATED in favor of [qTranslate X](http://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate-x/).** Based on qTranslate, adds userfriendly multilingual content management and translation support, with collaborative and team-oriented extensions.

Description
-----------
**As of February 19th, 2015, this plugin has been deprecated in favor of [qTranslate X](http://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate-x/).**

Writing multilingual content is already hard enough, why make using a plugin even more complicated? qTranslate has been created to let Wordpress have an easy to use interface for managing a fully multilingual web site.

mqTranslate is a fork of the well-known qTranslate plugin, extending the original software with collaborative and team-oriented features.

qTranslate makes creation of multilingual content as easy as working with a single language. Here are some features:

- qTranslate Services - Professional human and automated machine translation with two clicks
- One-Click-Switching between the languages - Change the language as easy as switching between Visual and HTML
- Language customizations without changing the .mo files - Use Quick-Tags instead for easy localization
- Multilingual dates out of the box - Translates dates and time for you
- Comes with a lot of languages already builtin! - English, German, Simplified Chinese and a lot of others
- No more juggling with .mo-files! - mqTranslate will download them automatically for you
- Choose one of 3 Modes to make your URLs pretty and SEO-friendly. - The everywhere compatible `?lang=en`, simple and beautiful `/en/foo/` or nice and neat `en.yoursite.com`
- One language for each URL - Users and SEO will thank you for not mixing multilingual content

qTranslate supports infinite languages, which can be easily added/modified/deleted via the comfortable Configuration Page.
All you need to do is activate the plugin and start writing the content!

For more Information on qTranslate, visit the [Original qTranslate Homepage](http://www.qianqin.de/qtranslate/).

mqTranslate adds the following features to qTranslate:

- Language selection for editor accounts (allows your translators to see only their source and target languages)
- Protection of concurrent edits of different languages (ie your english and german translators can save their work at the same time without risking data loss)

Installation
------------

**As of February 19th, 2015, this plugin has been deprecated in favor of [qTranslate X](http://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate-x/).**

Installation of this plugin is fairly easy:

* As with any plugin update / installation, save your database.
* Install mqTranslate through the plugins administration panel, **but don't activate it yet**.

If your install already includes qTranslate, follow these steps:

* Disable qTranslate but keep it installed for the moment
* Activate mqTranslate
* Go to mqTranslate Languages settings page and use our settings migration to copy qTranslate original settings automatically
* Enable mqTranslate and check everything works fine. If not, disable the plugin and enable qTranslate again. If yes, you can remove mqTranslate installation (but I suggest you keep it as it is harmless once disabled and it can help you if you discover later bugs with mqTranslate).
* Add the mqTranslate Widget to let your visitors switch the language.

If your install does not include qTranslate, you can go with it:

* Activate mqTranslate
* Add the mqTranslate Widget to let your visitors switch the language.

Upgrade Notice
--------------

WARNING!
Original qTranslate software provides a specific version of the plugin for each version of WordPress. qTranslate is only compatible with the WordPress version it has been designed for.
As a fork, mqTranslate inherits some drawbacks of this issue, despite our efforts to reduce its impact.
Be aware of the fact that upgrading your WordPress installation to a new version prior the availability of the matching qTranslate or mqTranslate release will disable those plugins.
