== Description ==

>[Pro Version](https://halgatewood.com/downloads/awesome-weather-widget-pro/) available. Weather icons, 5 New Layouts and Custom Templates, Weather by Yahoo! (no API key required), User Location Detection, Email Support.

This plugin allows you to easily add super clean (and awesome) weather widgets to your site. 

The weather data is provided for free by http://openweathermap.org and as of October 2015, they require an [API Key](http://openweathermap.org/appid#get) to access their weather. 
Once you have the API Key you can simply add it in 'Settings' -> 'Awesome Weather' and you're ready to go. 

[View the API Key Help Document](https://halgatewood.com/docs/plugins/awesome-weather-widget/register-for-an-openweathermap-api-key-appid)
